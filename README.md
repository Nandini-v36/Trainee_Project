# Trainee Project

## Description
Trainee Project is a web application consisting of two main parts: the **Frontend** and **Backend**. 

- **Trainee Frontend** is built with React.js and provides a user interface for interacting with trainee data.
- **Trainee Backend** is an API built using Node.js and Express.js to manage trainee data.

The two parts communicate with each other, with the frontend sending requests to the backend to perform basic color changing operations on welcome page.
